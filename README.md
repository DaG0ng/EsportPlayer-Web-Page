This is a web page using interactive data visualization design to help one choose their esport career.
In this web page, we used various charts to visualize esports market. Also, we used linear regression to predict the future of esports market. In the end, we made a survey to help the user decide their career. All the results are generated from our self-scrapping data from escharts, steamcharts and statista.
